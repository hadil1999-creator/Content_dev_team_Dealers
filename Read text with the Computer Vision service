•	[In this module, we'll focus on the use of OCR technologies to detect text in images and convert it into a text-based data format, which can then be stored, printed, or used as the input for further processing or analysis.]at the end of the unit

•	Add photos/schema in every subtitle so that the learner can include all his senses when learning.

•	I suggest the computer vision services to read text(OCR API and Read API) would be introduced in a table to make the content clear, short, organized, highlight the difference between them: Definition, Process, Results

•	The exercise is better be a lab( sandbox included ) for those who won’t want to lose their azure subscription fees in small demos.

•	The screenshots took many spaces. Preferably just list the instructions and at the end of the unit, a demo video of maximum 2mins explains the exercise for those who encounter difficulties.

•	The “Learn More” part in unit 3 is not essential. The learner wants all the “Learn more” links in the same place at the end of the course for further informations if he/she wants to extend their knowledge.

•	Increase the number of knowledge check questions which should be theorique and also relating to coding and azure steps.

•	The clean up part in “Summary” unit should be integrated after the exercise because normally the learner shut down the sandbox or exit the azure portal after he finished the exercise unit.
